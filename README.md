This game is a top-down, tile-based adventure that weaves together three distinct modes of play:

* **Tactical Battles:** On dedicated battle maps, you engage in turn-based combat where each action has a time cost. Position your hero, choose attacks or abilities, and outmaneuver foes on a grid, with a dynamic action queue deciding who goes next.

* **Strategic World Travel:** Between encounters, you traverse a node-based world map in a turn-based fashion, plotting your route from town to town. Every journey advances an in-game clock, so planning stops for rest or detours to hidden locales becomes part of the strategy.

* **Real-Time City Life:** Upon entering a settlement, the game shifts to a continuously updating scene. Wander bustling streets, converse with vendors and NPCs, haggle over wares in the marketplace, and follow branching dialogues that shape your relationships and story.

Seamless transitions link these modes: victory in battle unlocks new world destinations, and discoveries on the world map lead you into vibrant city interiors. Along the way, a shared cast of characters and persistent progression ensure that every fight, journey, and conversation contributes to a cohesive, evolving adventure.
